## Packet Processing Script

This script processes pcap files in a specified directory and analyzes the packet data. It extracts relevant information from different protocols and sends it to a model for further processing.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- `scapy` library
- `v2.llm_model` module (provide details about how to obtain/install it)

### Usage
1. Set up the environment and install the necessary dependencies.
2. Replace the `"/path/to/directory"` with the path to the directory containing pcap files that you want to process.
3. Run the script using the command: `python packet_processing_script.py`.
4. The script will iterate through all the pcap files in the specified directory, analyze the packets, and send the extracted information to the model for further processing.

Make sure to provide the required dependencies and any additional instructions for using the script effectively.


## Model Processing Utilities

This script provides utility functions for working with different text generation models, including GPT models and GPU-accelerated GPT models.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- `gpt4all` library (provide details about how to obtain/install it)
- `transformers` library (provide details about how to obtain/install it)
- `gpu_gpt` module (provide details about how to obtain/install it)

### Usage
1. Set up the environment and install the necessary dependencies.
2. Import the required functions from the `model_processing_utils` module.
3. Use the functions as needed in your code.

### Function Details
- `create_pipeline_model(model_name="openchat/openchat_8192")`: Creates a pipeline model for text generation.
  - `model_name` (str): The name or path of the model to use. Default is "openchat/openchat_8192".
  - Returns: The pipeline model for text generation.

- `pipe_response_generate(pipe, text)`: Generates a response using the pipeline model.
  - `pipe` (pipeline): The pipeline model for text generation.
  - `text` (str): The input text to generate a response for.
  - Returns: The generated response.

- `create_gpt_model(model_name)`: Creates a GPT model instance.
  - `model_name` (str): The name or path of the GPT model.
  - Returns: The GPT model instance.

- `create_gpu_gpt_model(model_name, base_path=None)`: Creates a GPU GPT model instance.
  - `model_name` (str): The name or path of the GPU GPT model.
  - `base_path` (str): The base path of the GPU GPT model. Default is None.
  - Returns: The GPU GPT model instance.

Make sure to provide the required dependencies and any additional instructions for using the functions effectively.


## Packet Analysis Prompts

This script provides utility functions to generate prompts for analyzing packets and determining if they are malicious or not.

### Function Details
- `generate_first_prompt(packet_count)`: Generates the initial prompt for analyzing packets.
  - `packet_count` (int): The number of packets to analyze.
  - Returns: The generated prompt.

- `generate_prompt(protocol, payload)`: Generates a prompt for analyzing a packet with the given protocol and payload.
  - `protocol` (str): The protocol of the packet.
  - `payload` (str): The payload of the packet.
  - Returns: The generated prompt.

- `generate_part_prompt(protocol, payload, count, total)`: Generates a prompt for analyzing a part of a packet's payload.
  - `protocol` (str): The protocol of the packet.
  - `payload` (str): The payload of the packet part.
  - `count` (int): The part count of the payload.
  - `total` (int): The total number of parts.
  - Returns: The generated prompt.

- `generate_part_prompt_final()`: Generates the final prompt for analyzing the parts of a packet's payload.
  - Returns: The generated prompt.

Use these functions to generate prompts for analyzing packets and determining their maliciousness. Provide the required inputs and follow the instructions provided in the prompts to categorize the packets as "Malicious" or "Not Malicious."
